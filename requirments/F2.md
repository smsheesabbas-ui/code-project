# Feature 2: Business Entity Structuring Layer

## Overview

The Business Entity Structuring Layer replaces traditional accounting chart-of-accounts with intuitive, business-friendly entities.

Instead of:

* Ledger codes
* Account trees
* Double-entry complexity

We use:

* Customers
* Suppliers
* Revenue Streams
* Expense Categories
* Tags

The goal is clarity over compliance.

A business owner should understand where money comes from and where it goes without learning accounting.
