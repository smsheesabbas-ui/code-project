# Feature 4: Conversational Financial Assistant

## Overview

The Conversational Financial Assistant enables business owners to interact with their financial data using natural language.

Instead of navigating dashboards and reports, users can simply ask:

* “Who is my top customer?”
* “Why was last month lower?”
* “Can I afford to hire someone?”
* “How much did I spend on marketing?”

The assistant translates user questions into data queries and returns clear, plain-language insights with contextual advice.

The goal is simplicity, speed, and intelligence.
